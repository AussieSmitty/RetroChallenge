# RetroChallenge
Using the Commodore 64 to control a remote control car. Control of the RC car can be via a joystick and recorded (to a floppy disk) for later autonomous 'play back' by the C64. The C64 will use RS232 to a microcontroller with a wireless transceiver that can connect to the RC car.

The code on the Arduinos used in this project is written using the IDE in the standard C++.

The code on the Commodore 64 will initially be in BASIC, but will likely be re-written in
either Forth (DurexForth) or assembler.

This project has been entered in the RetroChallenge 2021/10 competion.
